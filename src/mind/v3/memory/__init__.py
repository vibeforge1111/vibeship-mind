"""Mind v3 cognitive memory system.

Implements cognitively-inspired memory architecture:
- Working memory: Current session focus
- Episodic memory: Specific events with context
- Semantic memory: Generalized knowledge
- Procedural memory: Learned workflows
- Prospective memory: Future intentions/reminders

Processes:
- Encoding: Event -> Working memory
- Consolidation: Episodic -> Semantic
- Retrieval: Query -> Relevant memories
- Decay: Active -> Dormant
- Reinforcement: Use -> Strengthen
