"""Mind v3 progressive autonomy system.

Autonomy levels (1-5):
1. RECORD ONLY: Observe and capture
2. SUGGEST: Propose based on precedent
3. ASK PERMISSION: Propose with confidence
4. ACT + NOTIFY: Act automatically, inform user
5. SILENT: Handle automatically, log only

Mind earns trust through demonstrated good judgment.
