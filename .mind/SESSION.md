## Experience
<!-- Raw moments, thoughts, what's happening -->

- Integrating Phases 6-9 into mind_recall() - wiring up decay, reinforcement, contradiction, and learning style into the main flow
- Starting Phase 9 (Learning Style) - the AGI step: model HOW user learns, not just WHAT
- Starting Phase 8 (Contradiction Detection) - uses Jaccard similarity for keyword overlap, detects opposing words
- Phase 6-7 plan: 1) PatternMetadata dataclass 2) decay calculation 3) pattern_metadata.json storage 4) reinforce_pattern() 5) integrate into mind_recall 6) add reinforce log type 7) tests
- Starting Phase 6 (Confidence Decay) + Phase 7 (Reinforcement) implementation
