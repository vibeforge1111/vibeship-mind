CONTEXT_TEMPLATE = """## Memory (Mind)

This project uses Mind for persistent memory across sessions.

### Required Protocol

1. **Session Start**: ALWAYS call `mind_recall()` before responding to the first message. This loads context from previous sessions.

2. **During Work**: When you make decisions, hit issues, or learn gotchas, append to `.mind/MEMORY.md` directly:
   - `decided X because Y` - for decisions
   - `problem: X` - for issues
   - `learned that X` / `TIL: X` - for learnings
   - `gotcha: X` - for things that will bite again
   - `KEY: X` or `important: X` - for things that should never fade

3. **Session End**: Summarize with `## DATE | what happened | mood: X`

4. **No Daemon Needed**: Mind v2 is MCP-only. `recall()` handles session detection automatically.

### Tools Available

- `mind_recall()` - Load session context (CALL FIRST!)
- `mind_search(query)` - Find specific memories
- `mind_checkpoint()` - Force process pending memories
- `mind_edges(intent)` - Check for gotchas before coding
- `mind_status()` - Check memory health
