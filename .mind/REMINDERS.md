- [ ] 2025-12-13 | next session | Check if reminder marking works - mark_reminder_done() exists but isn't exposed via MCP tool. Either add mind_reminder_done tool or auto-mark on recall.
- [ ] self-improvement | context | Design SELF_IMPROVE.md once session system is validated - meta-learning layer for patterns, blind spots, what works
- [x] 2025-12-13 | done | Improve reminders with context-matching (Phase B) - add keyword triggers like 'remind me when we work on auth'
- [x] 2025-12-13 | done | Improve reminders with context-matching
