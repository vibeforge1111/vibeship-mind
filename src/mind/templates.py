CONTEXT_TEMPLATE = """# IMPORTANT: Write memories as you work

Append to `.mind/MEMORY.md` throughout the conversation (not just at the end):

**Decisions** - when you choose something:
- `decided X because Y`
- `chose X over Y because Z`
- Include alternatives you rejected and why

**Problems** - when something breaks or blocks:
- `problem: X`
- `stuck on X`
- Add symptoms, what you've tried, current theory

**Learnings** - when you discover something:
- `learned that X`
- `TIL: X`
- `gotcha: X` (for things that will bite again)

**Progress** - when you fix or complete:
- `fixed X by doing Y`
- `resolved X`

**Session end** - before ending, note:
- What's still open
- What to do next
- Mood (frustrated/stuck/breakthrough/accomplished)
