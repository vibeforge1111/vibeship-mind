# Session: 2025-12-13

## The Goal
<!-- USER OUTCOME, not technical task. What does success look like for the user? -->
<!-- Example: "User can upload images and see them in their gallery" -->
<!-- NOT: "Implement image upload endpoint" -->

## Current Approach
<!-- What you're trying RIGHT NOW. Include pivot condition. -->
<!-- Format: "Doing X. Pivot if: Y" -->
<!-- Example: "Using multer for uploads. Pivot if: memory issues with large files" -->

## Blockers
<!-- Things stopping progress. When you add here, SEARCH MEMORY for solutions. -->
<!-- Each blocker triggers: mind_search(blocker_keywords) -->

## Rejected Approaches
<!-- Strategic decisions, not tactical failures. Include WHY to prevent circles. -->
<!-- Format: "Approach - Why rejected" -->
<!-- Example: "Client-side resize - Quality loss unacceptable for photography app" -->

## Working Assumptions
<!-- Things you're assuming true. Question these when stuck. -->
<!-- Example: "User has stable internet" / "Files under 10MB" -->

## Discoveries
<!-- Findings that matter. Tech patterns get promoted to MEMORY.md on session end. -->
